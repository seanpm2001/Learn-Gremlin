// Project language file 1
// For: seanpm2001/Learn-Gremlin
// About:
// I decided to make Gremlin the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Gremlin) as Gremlin is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Gremlin programming language. It only makes sense to Gremlin the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
